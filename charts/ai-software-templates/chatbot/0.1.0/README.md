# AI Software Template Helm Chart

This repo is a Helm chart for building and deploying a Large language model (LLM)-enabled [chat application](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-samples/tree/main/chatbot). For more information about helm charts see the official [Helm Charts Documentation](https://helm.sh/).

The deployment flow, will create an application instance, a model server and a github repository with all the application contents in the given github organization. See the [background](#background) section for more information.

## Requirements

- You have a Github APP created with sufficient permissions for the organization that the application repository will be created. Detailed instructions for the github application creation can be found [here](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-rhdh-installer/blob/main/docs/APP-SETUP.md#github-app).
- You need to have access to a cluster for each operation with OpenShift 4, like deploying and testing.
- The Namespace that your application will run is already created in your cluster.
- Your cluster should have [Openshift Pipelines Operator](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/pipelines) installed and should be connected to your Github APP's webhook. In case your cluster is not configured yet, check the ["Pipelines Configuration Guide"](../../../../docs/PIPELINES_CONFIGURATION.md) for further instructions.
- A `key/value` Secret is already created in the Namespace that you are planning to install your helm release, containing a [Github Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) with sufficient access to the given Github Organization. You can find the exact permissions [here](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-rhdh-installer/blob/main/docs/APP-SETUP.md#procedure). Your Secret's name and the Key of the github token will be provided as values to the helm chart.

## Background

The chatbot helm chart utilizes two main deployments:

1. The model service deployment, based on `llama.cpp` inference server and related to the [ai-lab-recipes model server](https://github.com/containers/ai-lab-recipes/tree/main/model_servers/llamacpp_python).
2. The application deployment, a Streamlit based application to interact with the model service. The application is based on the related [Chatbot Template](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-template/tree/main/templates/chatbot/content).

Apart from the two main deployments, the gitops & OpenShift Pipelines parts are handled by the following:

1. The [application-gitops-job](./templates/application-gitops-job.yaml) which takes care of the application github repository creation.
2. The [tekton Repository](./templates/tekton-repository.yaml) which connects our application with the `pipeline-as-code-controller` and we are able to manage all webhooks received from our Github App.

## Installation

The helm chart can be directly installed from the OpenShift Dev Console. Check [here](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.8/html/building_applications/working-with-helm-charts#understanding-helm) for more information.

### Install using Helm

In order to install AI Software Template Helm chart using helm directly, you can run:

```
helm upgrade --install <release-name> --namespace <release-namespace> .
```
